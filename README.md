LAIR Development Manifest
=========================
This repository should help me keep my projects folder better organized. It's
an android-style manifest I'm going to do releases of my game with. Some other
stuff too.

        repo init -u github.com:cmotc/lair-manifest.git
        repo sync --force-sync

Next thing on the agenda is that all these guys get Jenkinsfiles.
